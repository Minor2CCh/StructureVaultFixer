# About

This MOD fixes an issue where Vaults in certain structures added after version 1.21 would not activate, preventing players from obtaining loot.
Normally, Vaults activate when a player approaches them, and loot can be obtained using an (Ominous) Trial Key. However, Vaults in structures added by MODs might not activate even when approached, preventing loot retrieval.

This mod resolves the issue for Vaults that fail to activate upon approach.
