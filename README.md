# About

This MOD fixes an issue where treasure chests in certain structures added after version 1.21 would not activate, preventing players from obtaining loot.
Normally, treasure chests activate when a player approaches them, and loot can be obtained using an (Ominous) Trial Key. However, treasure chests in structures added by MODs might not activate even when approached, preventing loot retrieval.

This mod resolves the issue for treasure chests that fail to activate upon approach.
